99. **How do I use template.py templates?**

    For basic doc and some code snippets, see [[templetor|template.py doc]]

    To display your page from inside a web.py app, just do

            homepage = template.Template(open("homepage.tmpl").read())
            print homepage()

    
99. **Why are the urls just one long list?**

    If they were a dictionary, they wouldn't be ordered. If it was a list of tuples, then it'd be a lot more typing.

99. **Where can I go for additional help?**

    Google Groups has a [web.py group](http://groups.google.com/group/webpy) that is quite helpful.

99. **How can I change the default "not found" page?**

    You can write your own custom notfound handler and assign it to web.webapi.notfound

            def my_notfound(): 
                print "MY OWN NOT FOUND" 
            web.webapi.notfound = my_notfound 

99. **How can i get auto completion in python after loading the webpy module?**

    You probably have discover that the auto completion no more work once you import the webpy module in ipython. You can still use 'python' with auto completion feature. Try it out directly. Fire up 'python':

            import readline, rlcompleter; readline.parse_and_bind("tab: complete")

    and tab it! :-)

    To make in sort that this will be run default when you fire up 'python'. Make a file called '~/.pythonstartup.py' and put the import line in it. Then set the 'PYTHONSTARTUP' environment variable to point to that file.

    With my bash, i do it like folling; edit ~/.bashrc and add:

            export PYTHONSTARTUP=/home/david/.pythonstartup.py
