The format used for editing is called [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/markdown/).
Check out the [cheat sheet](http://daringfireball.net/markdown/dingus/). If you want to 
make a link, put two square brackets on either side of some words, like `\[[this]]`.

To change site preferences, click the prefs link to the side.

To add something to your sidebar, click the link labeled `\{{sidebar}}` over there.
