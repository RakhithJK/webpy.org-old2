**web.py** is a web framework for python that is as simple as it is powerful. web.py is in the public domain; you can use it for whatever purpose with absolutely no restrictions.

##A complete web.py application

    urls = (
        '/(.*)', 'hello'
    )
    app = web.application(urls, globals())
    
    class hello:        
        def GET(self, name):
            if not name: 
                name = 'World'
            return 'Hello, ' + name + '!'
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run()

## Who uses web.py?

web.py was originally published while Aaron Swartz worked at [reddit.com][20], where the site used it as it grew to become one of the top 1000 sites according to Alexa and served millions of daily page views. "It's the anti-framework framework. web.py doesn't get in your way," explained founder Steve Huffman. (The site was rewritten using other tools after being acquired by Condé Nast.)
