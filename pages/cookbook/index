# Web.py Cookbook

Cookbook style documentation for web.py 0.3. Note that some of these features aren't available in previous versions.  Currently version 0.3 is the development branch.

#Formatting

1. In terms of formatting, please try to use a cookbook-like format...that is:
    
    ###Problem: You want to access data from database.
     
    ###Solution: Use this code...

1. Note that the urls don't need "web" in them -- just "/cookbook/select" , not "/cookbook/web.select".  

1. Finally, this documentation is for version 0.3, so please only add code that you know works with the new version.
