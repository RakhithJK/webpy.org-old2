# Webpy + Apache with mod_wsgi

The following steps was tested on Apache-2.2.3 (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2, x86_64), mod_wsgi-2.0.

Note:

* You may replace 'appname' with your own project name.
* You may replace code.py with your own file name.
* /var/www/webpy-app found below refers to the path to the directory contains your code.py
* /var/www/webpy-app/code.py is the full path to your python file

Steps:

* Download and install mod_wsgi from its website: http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/. It will install a '.so' module in Apache module directory. e.g.

        /usr/lib64/httpd/modules/

* Configure Apache to load mod_wsgi module and your project in httpd.conf:

        LoadModule wsgi_module modules/mod_wsgi.so

        WSGIScriptAlias /appname /var/www/webpy-app/code.py

        <Directory /var/www/webpy-app/>
            Order deny,allow
            Allow from all
        </Directory>
