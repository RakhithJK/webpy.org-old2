# dreamhost

There is currently a page on the Dreamhost wiki <a href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/index.php/Web.py">for web.py</a>.   The instructions there will work, just give plenty of time for FastCGI to be enabled.  Dreamhost's panel application says 10 minutes but it may take much longer.

For a <a href="http://svn.natalian.org/projects/todo/.htaccess">.htaccess</a> that works.
