# Testing webpy applications

Python Paste has a wsgi wrapper that intercepts requests to your application
and enables you to test for the correct responses/status codes etc.  Here's
a simple example (making sure the helloworld app works correctly).

    import web

    urls = (
        '/(.*)', 'hello'    )

    class hello:
        def GET(self, name):
            i = web.input(times=1)
            if not name: name = 'world'            for c in xrange(int(i.times)): print 'Hello,', name+'!'
    #if __name__ == "__main__": web.run(urls)  # don't run as usual


    from paste.fixture import TestApp, TestResponse
    from web import webpyfunc, wsgifunc

    middleware = []
    app = wsgifunc(webpyfunc(urls, globals()), *middleware)
    app = TestApp(app)

    r = app.get("/")
    assert "Hello" in r
